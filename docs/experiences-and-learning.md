My primary motivation to develop Mediakit was that I couldn't find any tools to download YouTube videos that fully met my demands and provided me a good user experience, be it displaying excessive advertisements, having slow downloads and limited resolutions or even containing viruses. Because of these limitations, I decided to fill this gap by creating **Mediakit**, a command line tool to download YouTube videos quickly and reliably.

Developing Mediakit has been accompanied by great technical challenges for me, such as:
- Providing a good user experience in a command line environment, which included designing an interactive, intuitive, user-friendly interface.
- Developing an scalable architecture, in order to remove obstacles that could hinder maintenance and upgrades, which challenged me to look for design patterns, best practices and code quality.
- Dealing with media, such as downloading and converting different formats, proving itself to be quite interesting and leading me to learn many aspects about working with media files.
- Providing compatibility and efficiency to a wide range of users' environments.
- Working with version control systems, specially Git and GitHub, and how to structure my work in a consistent, comprehensive way.

Working in Mediakit has been a great learning journey for me, and I hope to have contributed by providing an easy and reliable way to download videos from YouTube. :slightly_smiling_face:
